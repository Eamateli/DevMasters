					"title": "What is Git?",
					"description": "Git is a distributed version control system that allows multiple people to collaborate on software development projects. It tracks changes in the source code, enables team coordination, and helps in managing project versions effectively. Git works by creating a repository to store the project's files and their complete history. It allows developers to work on different branches simultaneously and merge their changes later, making it easier to manage complex projects with multiple contributors.",

				{
					"title": "Why use Git?",
					"description": "Git helps in keeping track of changes made to the codebase, facilitates collaboration among team members, allows for easy branching and merging, and provides a backup of the project. It also enables developers to work offline and merge their changes when they are back online.",
					"code": ""
				},
				{
					"title": "Git Workflow",
					"description": "In a typical Git workflow, developers start by initializing a Git repository using the 'git init' command. They then create or clone a repository from a remote source using 'git clone <repository URL>'. Developers work on their local copies, making changes to files and staging those changes using 'git add <file>'. After staging changes, they commit them using 'git commit -m 'Your commit message here''. Commits create a snapshot of the changes, preserving the project's history. To share changes with others, developers use 'git push' to upload changes to a remote repository and 'git pull' to fetch changes from a remote repository and merge them into their local branch. Branches are used to work on different features or fixes independently. Branches can be created with 'git branch <branch name>' and switched using 'git checkout <branch name>' or in recent Git versions, 'git switch <branch name>'. Merging changes from one branch to another is done using 'git merge <branch name>'.",

				{
					"title": ".gitignore File",
					"description": "The .gitignore file is used to specify intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore. These files can be build artifacts, temporary files, or any other files that are not meant to be committed. By adding patterns to the .gitignore file, you can ensure that these files do not clutter your repository and are not accidentally committed.",
